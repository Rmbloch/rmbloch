## 🧠 About Me

I'm a passionate developer and full-time student at the University of Pittsburgh, pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science with a minor in Business. I have experience in both front-end and back-end development, working with modern technologies like React, Python, Node, Ruby on Rails, and OpenAI's APIs. I'm always eager to learn and take on new challenges that push me out of my comfort zone.

## 📚 Education

As a full-time student and rising senior at the University of Pittsburgh, I expect to graduate in April 2026. Throughout my two full years at Pitt, I have completed rigorous coursework towards the Computer Science degree, such as Algorithms and Data Structures 1 & 2, Computer Organization & Assembly Language, Software Engineer, Database Management Systems, and Systems Programming. While maintaining a GPA above 3.7, I also stay actively involved in various coding projects, hackathons, and on-campus clubs.

## 🛠️ Projects

### 📈 Options Bot

Built a sophisticated options trading program that leverages AI to identify profitable options opportunities. The bot monitors real-time market data, processes unusual options activity through a custom scoring algorithm, and uses GPT to generate clear trading recommendations. Features include automated Telegram alerts, Docker deployment, and a modular architecture that allows easy integration of new data sources and analysis techniques.

### 🎥 YouTube Video Automation

Created a Python program that fully automates the creation of a video and uploads it to a YouTube channel. The GitHub repository linked goes in-depth on the technologies I used to create this project. The purpose of this project was to gain more experience with Python and challenge myself to build something that I have never attempted before.

### 🛡️ LaterHater Chrome Extension

Originally called Hate Blocker, LaterHater is a Chrome Extension that uses a natural language model to detect hate speech and block it from a social media feed. This extension was created by me and two other team members for a local hackathon and sought to tackle the issue of online hate in social media. As LLMs become more advanced, I plan to revisit this project and eventually release it to the public.

### 🌐 Personal Portfolio Website

I am including this website as a major project, not only because it is recent but because it was a project that required me to learn a lot of new technologies to complete the website. I combined my full-stack experience with unfamiliar technologies such as React and Next.js to build a visually appealing and responsive website.
